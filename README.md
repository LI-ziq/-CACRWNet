# CACRWNet
Context-aware and Channel re-weighting network with Noise suppression for Remote sensing scene classification

## Instruction
* `split.py`

Once you've obtained the necessary dataset, use `split.py` to proportionally partition the dataset into training and test sets. The code simply needs to change the source and new file paths and divide the ratio.

* `reshape.py`

Its role is to crop the image size to 224Ã—224, all you have to do is alter the source file directory and the new file location, and you can also change the size of the crop image.

* `train.py`

Change the path of the training and test sets first, then the number of experiments.
 
  `num_epochs = config.NUM_EPOCHS`
  
  `num = 1`

The optimizer can also be customized to meet your needs.

* `config.py`

You can change the data set category, training batch size, number of training rounds, and path to store the model from `config.py`.
